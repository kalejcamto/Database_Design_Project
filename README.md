# Database_Design_Project
MySQL Workbench used to create a database from zero for a company of private trainers on software education, the company is made of software instructors who deliver training services to emerging tech companies.

## FIRST PHASE OF THE PROJECT

I created the first draft EER DIAGRAM based on the analysis of the business. This is a ficticious case study to create an organic and scalable database design. 
It is a first model it is going to be updated later.
It is a software training company, I named it TECHLEARN SOLUTIONS, company of trainers offer live courses/training to tech companies onsite or online and they need a database to handle their business. 

I started off by thinking of the most important tables for this database and the relationships: 

This is my first draft of proposal of the DATABASE DESIGN: 


  ### Company description and solution proposal

businesses across various industries. They offer a wide range of training modules covering 
popular programming languages, development frameworks, and software tools. Instructors 
deliver both in-person and virtual training sessions to meet the specific needs and goals of their 
clients.
This database was built with the purpose of efficiently managing their training programs and

that efficiently manages their trainers, clients, and training programs. This centralized hub 
organizes course offerings, pricing, maintains trainer and client details, and tracking training 
sessions.
